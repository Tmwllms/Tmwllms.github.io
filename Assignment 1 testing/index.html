      </h3>
      <p>
        The first thing that immediately caught my attention was the bold color
        choices and contrasting design elements present in the first top
        box/page. It features an artist statement where users can manipulate a
        color intersection, revealing interchangeable words such as
        "passionate," "interested," "obsessed," and "desire." The interplay of
        vibrant hues and the dynamic visual contrast effectively drew my eye to
        the text and layout, creating a visually striking first impression that
        set the tone for the rest of the experience.

          3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The section I spent the most time engaging with was the interactive
          artist statement on the first page. The ability to manipulate the
          intersection of colors and observe how different words changed within
          the statement encouraged repeated interaction, as I explored various
          combinations and their visual impact. Moreover, this repeated
          interaction made me feel increasingly like I was directly connecting
          with the artist’s design abilities and personal beliefs, as each
          combination of interchangeable words evoked a different emotional
          response from me.

          4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
          the experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The most common action I performed in my two minute interaction
          exercise was using my cursor to drag the cross intersection of the
          four colors around the interchangeable words. This action allowed me
          to see each variation and how the changing hues interacted with the
          text, making it an engaging and dynamic experience.

        </h3>
        <p>
          My impression of the intended primary goal of this interactive
          experience, is that it appears to be showcasing the designer’s deep
          passion and expertise in web design. Through both verbal declarations
          and practical demonstrations, the site effectively communicates the
          creator’s technical skills and artistic sensibility to potential
          clients and collaborators.

        <h3 class="question-heading">
          6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The interactive nature of the artists statement effectively conveys
          his multifaceted appreciation and enthusiasm for web design. By using
          bold, interchangeable words and high-modality language, the experience
          immediately presents his passion and motivation. Additionally, the
          carefully crafted interactive elements and their clear adoption of
          exemplary color theory understanding act as direct demonstrations of
          his technical proficiency, offering potential clients a firsthand look
          at his skills and design knowledge in action. Furthermore, through
          observing the dynamic functionality of the artist statement
          interaction, it can be deduced that a combination of HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript used to detect cursor movements, with the JavaScript
          function (updateWord()) serving to change words as users move the
          cursor. As a result, it can be said that this interactive element also
          serves as a metaphor for demonstrating the designer’s mastering of
          interchanging multiple coding languages. In the final section, the
          designer uses CSS transitions and transformations to enable users
          hovering over rows of large text to trigger unique rearrangement
          animations. The CSS & JavaScript (rearrangeText()) match similar
          hover-based rearranging text effects on the website, reinforcing how
          interactive animations subtly invite users to explore further.
        </p>
        <h3 class="question-heading">
          7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        </h3>
        <p>
          The web experience is designed to be short yet impactful. It delivers
          immediate engagement through visually striking elements and
          interactive features that encourage exploration. As a result, my
          impression is that this experience is intended for brief but repeated
          interactions, where users may revisit specific elements to further
          appreciate the intricacy and creativity embedded in the design. If I
          had to give an estimate on how much time the average user should
          interact with this experience for, I’d say about a minute to a minute
          and thirty seconds, with the number of times returning to the site
          definitely within the infinite. This is as I found myself repeatedly
          coming back to the site outside of this project’s research
          requirements, just to see what other clues I could find in the
          intricate interactive elements.
        </p>
        <h3 class="question-heading">
          8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The design elements and interactivity suggest that users are
          encouraged to return and further explore the experience. The intricate
          wordplay and letter rearrangements toward the end of the site serve as
          subtle invitations for users to take a closer look at the details,
          fostering a deeper appreciation of the designer’s craftsmanship over
          multiple interactions.
        </p>
        <h3 class="question-heading">
          9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The experience clearly references a fundamental HTML element, ‘< div
          >’ showcasing the designer’s ability to perfectly center a div as seen
          in the interactive triangle and text feature below the artist
          statement. The designer created the interaction using CSS transform to
          dynamically rearrange the words and JavaScript (flipTriangle()) to
          flip the triangle, thus mirroring how the website showcases his web
          design skills. Additionally, the experience references the ‘pixel
          displacement effect,’ a visual technique used in digital media where
          pixels in an image or video are shifted or distorted based on a
          control layer/map, creating the illusion of depth, texture, or unique
          distortions. Furthermore, by integrating this effect into the site as
          an interactive element, the designer demonstes his familiarity with
          modern web development and digital artistry.
        </p>
        <h3 class="question-heading">
          10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          act when engaging with your research experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
          These media references to coding in HTML and visual effects suggest
          that user’s are encouraged to engage with media relevant to the
          creator’s practice in order to understand his skills and artistic
          perspective. Much like interacting with a digital art experience on
          the web, these media references are laid out as bold, stand-alone
          elements, inviting users to dwell, explore, experiment, and appreciate
          the intricacies of digital design through hands-on engagement.
          Additionally, the direct reference to HTML suggests that some users
          who come to visit the site are fellow web designers, programers,
          and/or coders of differing ability, with the expertise demonstrated in
          the experience encouraging these users to use the web’s ‘inspect’
          ability. Thus, allowing them to engage deeper with the site by
          appreciating the literal behind-the-scenes aspects of the site's
          functionality.
        </p>
        <h3 class="question-heading">
          11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          feel when engaging with your research experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The fusion of simplicity and interactivity in the artist’s biography
          creates an experience that feels both personal and immersive. The
          technical references, combined with the fluid interactivity, evoke a
          sense of authenticity and passion from the designer, generating in me
          a strong sense of appreciation for his work and skillset. Also, these
          references communicate that if the user were a programmer or web
          designer, then their engagement would not only evoke enhanced feelings
          of appreciation, but also a deep motivation for aspiring web designers
          to improve and experiment.

          12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part frustrating?
        </h3>
        <p>
          One of the most frustrating aspects of the interaction was the
          presence of grammatical errors within the artist statement, which
          slightly detracted from the otherwise polished and technically
          impressive presentation. However, I do consider that the grammatical
          errors could come from a language barrier as the designer is from
          Thailand. Thus, making these grammatical errors evoke a powerful sense
          of personal expression and authenticity. Additionally, the brevity of
          the experience left me wanting more; after successfully engaging the
          user, it would have been satisfying to explore further elements or
          additional layers of interaction. Moreover, this lack of more
          interactive demonstrations made me question the full scope of the
          designer's ability. Even the addition of just one more additional
          page, with an engaging interactive element would have been enough to
          ensure users would feel confident in his abilities.

          13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part satisfying?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The most satisfying part of the interaction was engaging with the
          various wordplay elements, particularly those at the end of the
          experience. The seamless animations and intricate details showcased a
          meticulous attention to craftsmanship, reinforcing the designers
          passion for web development. The execution of these effects felt
          refined and intentional, leaving a lasting impression of skill and
          creativity. Additionally, it felt satisfying as a designer to see a
          fellow designer playfully demonstrate their practice and personality
          through their artistry.
