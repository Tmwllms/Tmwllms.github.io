    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>
      The section I spent the most time engaging with was the interactive artist
      statement on the first page. The ability to manipulate the intersection of
      colors and observe how different words changed within the statement
      encouraged repeated interaction, as I explored various combinations and
      their visual impact. Moreover, this repeated interaction made me feel
      increasingly like I was directly connecting with the artist’s design
      abilities and personal beliefs, as each combination of interchangeable
      words evoked a different emotional response from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common action I performed in my two minute interaction exercise
      was using my cursor to drag the cross intersection of the four colors
      around the interchangeable words. This action allowed me to see each
      variation and how the changing hues interacted with the text, making it an
      engaging and dynamic experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      My impression of the intended primary goal of this interactive experience,
      is that it appears to be showcasing the designer’s deep passion and
      expertise in web design. Through both verbal declarations and practical
      demonstrations, the site effectively communicates the creator’s technical
      skills and artistic sensibility to potential clients and collaborators.

    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      The interactive nature of the artists statement effectively conveys his
      multifaceted appreciation and enthusiasm for web design. By using bold,
      interchangeable words and high-modality language, the experience
      immediately presents his passion and motivation. Additionally, the
      carefully crafted interactive elements and their clear adoption of
      exemplary color theory understanding act as direct demonstrations of his
      technical proficiency, offering potential clients a firsthand look at his
      skills and design knowledge in action. Furthermore, through observing the
      dynamic functionality of the artist statement interaction, it can be
      deduced that a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript used to detect
      cursor movements, with the JavaScript function (updateWord()) serving to
      change words as users move the cursor. As a result, it can be said that
      this interactive element also serves as a metaphor for demonstrating the
      designer’s mastering of interchanging multiple coding languages. In the
      final section, the designer uses CSS transitions and transformations to
      enable users hovering over rows of large text to trigger unique
      rearrangement animations. The CSS & JavaScript (rearrangeText()) match
      similar hover-based rearranging text effects on the website, reinforcing
      how interactive animations subtly invite users to explore further.
    </p>
    <p>
      The web experience is designed to be short yet impactful. It delivers
      immediate engagement through visually striking elements and interactive
      features that encourage exploration. As a result, my impression is that
      this experience is intended for brief but repeated interactions, where
      users may revisit specific elements to further appreciate the intricacy
      and creativity embedded in the design. If I had to give an estimate on how
      much time the average user should interact with this experience for, I’d
      say about a minute to a minute and thirty seconds, with the number of
      times returning to the site definitely within the infinite. This is as I
      found myself repeatedly coming back to the site outside of this project’s
      research requirements, just to see what other clues I could find in the
      intricate interactive elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The design elements and interactivity suggest that users are encouraged to
      return and further explore the experience. The intricate wordplay and
      letter rearrangements toward the end of the site serve as subtle
      invitations for users to take a closer look at the details, fostering a
      deeper appreciation of the designer’s craftsmanship over multiple
      interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The experience clearly references a fundamental HTML element, ‘< div >’
      showcasing the designer’s ability to perfectly center a div as seen in the
      interactive triangle and text feature below the artist statement. The
      designer created the interaction using CSS transform to dynamically
      rearrange the words and JavaScript (flipTriangle()) to flip the triangle,
      thus mirroring how the website showcases his web design skills.
      Additionally, the experience references the ‘pixel displacement effect,’ a
      visual technique used in digital media where pixels in an image or video
      are shifted or distorted based on a control layer/map, creating the
      illusion of depth, texture, or unique distortions. Furthermore, by
      integrating this effect into the site as an interactive element, the
      designer demonstes his familiarity with modern web development and digital
      artistry.
    </p>
    <p>
      These media references to coding in HTML and visual effects suggest that
      user’s are encouraged to engage with media relevant to the creator’s
      practice in order to understand his skills and artistic perspective. Much
      like interacting with a digital art experience on the web, these media
      references are laid out as bold, stand-alone elements, inviting users to
      dwell, explore, experiment, and appreciate the intricacies of digital
      design through hands-on engagement. Additionally, the direct reference to
      HTML suggests that some users who come to visit the site are fellow web
      designers, programers, and/or coders of differing ability, with the
      expertise demonstrated in the experience encouraging these users to use
      the web’s ‘inspect’ ability. Thus, allowing them to engage deeper with the
      site by appreciating the literal behind-the-scenes aspects of the site's
      functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fusion of simplicity and interactivity in the artist’s biography
      creates an experience that feels both personal and immersive. The
      technical references, combined with the fluid interactivity, evoke a sense
      of authenticity and passion from the designer, generating in me a strong
      sense of appreciation for his work and skillset. Also, these references
      communicate that if the user were a programmer or web designer, then their
      engagement would not only evoke enhanced feelings of appreciation, but
      also a deep motivation for aspiring web designers to improve and
      experiment.

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most frustrating aspects of the interaction was the presence of
      grammatical errors within the artist statement, which slightly detracted
      from the otherwise polished and technically impressive presentation.
      However, I do consider that the grammatical errors could come from a
      language barrier as the designer is from Thailand. Thus, making these
      grammatical errors evoke a powerful sense of personal expression and
      authenticity. Additionally, the brevity of the experience left me wanting
      more; after successfully engaging the user, it would have been satisfying
      to explore further elements or additional layers of interaction. Moreover,
      this lack of more interactive demonstrations made me question the full
      scope of the designer's ability. Even the addition of just one more
      additional page, with an engaging interactive element would have been
      enough to ensure users would feel confident in his abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most satisfying part of the interaction was engaging with the various
      wordplay elements, particularly those at the end of the experience. The
      seamless animations and intricate details showcased a meticulous attention
      to craftsmanship, reinforcing the designers passion for web development.
      The execution of these effects felt refined and intentional, leaving a
      lasting impression of skill and creativity. Additionally, it felt
      satisfying as a designer to see a fellow designer playfully demonstrate
      their practice and personality through their artistry.
