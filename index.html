<!-- @ ‘Need for Speed’s scroll function will operate as a traditional scroll section for 12 different fixed content boxes covering different vehicles and their top speeds. The time period in this scroll section will broadly cover all of the fastest vehicles across history according to technological development. The scroll section will cover the following vehicles: the Arabian horse (1000 BCE), Stephenson’s Rocket (1829), the Benz Patent-Motorwagen (1886), the Blitzen Benz (1911), the Supermarine S.6B Seaplane (1931), the Messerschmitt Me 262 (1944), the Bell X-1 (1947), the Bluebird CN7 (1964), the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird (1966), the North American X-15 (1967), the ThrustSSC (1997), and finally the Parker Solar Probe (2018–present, ongoing mission). As user’s scroll horizontally in this section, fixed content boxes attached to their respective vehicle will reveal themselves along with information regarding its top recorded speed, type, manufacturer/designer and context. 

The timeline progress bar at the bottom of the page will not require user’s to scroll, instead it will function as a sticky footer which progresses according to the vehicle scroll section. This effectively encourages passive discovery while placing a stronger focal point on the scroll section, thus pushing users to further explore and interact with the webpage. The progress bar will incorporate a minimalist design that makes it clear for users to see what time period they’re up to and a simple opacity fade at the its edges to keep the bottom of the page visually focused and not distracting. @ -->
